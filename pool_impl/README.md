# pool_impl

Build command:

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`

# plot_linked_tests.py

This is used to plot the different outputs of the executables from `test_linked_pool`.

Usage (make sure you build the project first):
* `python3 plot_linked_tests.py [relative-path-to-executable[name-of-txt-file-of-the-exec[number-of-objects]]]`

Examples:
* `python3 plot_linked_tests.py ./build/test_linked_pool/test_random ./random_time_taken.txt 100000`
* `python3 plot_linked_tests.py` will execute `test_normal`, supply the file `time_taken` and the value `100000`

Explanation:
* `./build/test_linked_pool/test_random` - the executable that we want to execute
* `./random_time_taken.txt` - the file generated by the executable
* `100000` - the upperbound of objects that will be created (in the case of `test_worst`, the upperbound is multiplied by `170`)
